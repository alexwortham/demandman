\section{Project Description}

The power grid in the United States is undergoing significant changes with
the addition of renewable energy sources and the phasing out of fossil
fuels.  A critical component in making these changes is better management of
the demand on the grid.  Currently power companies have no way of controlling
the demand on the grid, and must respond reactively to ensure that the demand is
met.  Responding to the changes in demand comes at significant cost to the power
companies, and these companies are beginning to shift these costs on to their
customers in the form of demand charges.  The technical details of demand
charges can be difficult for some people to understand, and many of those people
will soon be facing higher electric bills which they cannot understand.  The
purpose of our project is to give users a simple way to monitor the electricity
usage of the appliances in their homes and lower their bills by controlling when
major household appliances are run.  Given the time constraints on the project, we will be
simulating AC loads on custom built DC circuits to reduce design complexity.

\section{Summary}

As energy demand continues to rise, the associated costs are becoming an
important problem for many households. The average adult will likely have
difficulty understanding the method through which power companies are passing
this cost on to them, putting efficient management of electrical demand near
impossible. To alleviate this problem, our device seeks to demonstrate a system
through which households can easily manage their demand, thereby reducing their
electrical bill. By giving a single device through which to interface with their
major appliances, our project seeks to make energy conservation a manageable
task for the average household. We are designing a demonstration of the end user
system, as well as a method for simulating real loads for the system to manage.
The above requirements lay out the hardware and software needs of this project.
